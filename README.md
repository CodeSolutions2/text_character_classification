#  text_character_classification 

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate character prediction of the alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) using different model definitions of the LSTM model. The goal is to compare accuracy of different model definitions, to understand which model definitions are better than other for specific data.
